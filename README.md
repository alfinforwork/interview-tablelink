Documentation.
Tablelink Technical Test Documentation
1. Overview
This project is a Laravel 12 web application that implements user authentication, 
authorization, and management, following REST API standards, MVC architecture, and 
Dockerized deployment.
The application supports two roles:
• Admin
• User
Admins have access to dashboards and user management features, while normal users can 
only access a basic dashboard.
2. Technology Stack
• Backend Framework: Laravel 12
• Database: MySQL (via Docker)
• Authentication: Laravel Authentication (session-based or token-based)
• Authorization: Role-based access control (Admin, User)
• Charts: Chart.js (based on provided Gist references)
• Containerization: Docker & Docker Compose
• Testing: PHPUnit (Unit Tests)
• Architecture: MVC (Model-View-Controller)
• API Standard: RESTful API

7. Project Structure (MVC Best Practices)
Best Practices Applied
• Request validation separated using Form Request
• Business logic kept inside services or controllers
• Views split into reusable components
• Clean separation between API and UI logic
8. Dockerization
Dockerized Components
• Laravel Application
• Database (MySQL / PostgreSQL)
• Web Server (Nginx)
Docker Compose
• Single docker-compose.yml file
• Environment variables managed via .env
• One command setup:
docker-compose up -d
9. Testing
Unit Tests
• Each major function has corresponding unit tests:

– Authentication
– Authorization
– User CRUD
– Dashboard data generation
Testing Tools
• PHPUnit
• Laravel testing utilities
Run Tests
php artisan test
10. Security Considerations
• Password hashing using Laravel Hash
• Role-based middleware
• Soft delete to prevent accidental data loss
• Validation on all incoming requests
